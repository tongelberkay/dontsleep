### dontsleep is a tiny console app for address a very spesific issue which is;
# integrated display speakers stops when the screen goes sleep
it driving me *crazy* that windows doesn't have a solution for it
#### **so instead waiting for them to add this feature, i fixed it myself.**
<p> actually that's it.</p>
<p>maybe i will do a gui or make it bacground task with a tiny icon on the taskbar in the future if it starts to annoy me working as a terminal task.</p>
<p>also it needs to .net 6 required to in order to work</p>
